# PokemonTypeCoverage
By Jung Woo Lee, November 2023

What: Python program originally made to make Venn diagrams for Pokemon attack type coverage. Now has some additional functions.
Why: Playing PokeMMO and Gliscor had too many moves to choose from, all of different types. There was no tool that showed type coverage quite like I wished, thus I made this tool.
This is for Generation V, I may add functionality for only Generation IV later.
